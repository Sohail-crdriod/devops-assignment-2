Five DevOps Concepts :-

Commit
- A saved snapshot of work  
- Helps track what changed and when  

 Pair Programming
- Two developers share one task  
- One types, one reviews in real time  

Rollback
- Returning to a working version when something breaks  
- Prevents downtime and failures  

Continuous Deployment
- Code that passes automated tests goes live automatically  
- No human approval needed  

 Continuous Integration
- Developers merge updates frequently  
- Helps catch errors early  



How the assignment was completed :-

- Made a GitHub repository and opened it locally  
- Built a Dockerfile that performs basic Linux operations using simple shell utilities  
- Constructed the Docker image using:  
  `docker build -t linux-ops-box .`  
- Tagged the image for DockerHub using:  
  `docker tag linux-ops-box sohail222/linux-ops-box:v1`  
- Uploaded it using:  
  `docker push sohail222/linux-ops-box:v1`  
- My DockerHub link:  
  https://hub.docker.com/r/sohail222/linux-ops-box  

Added Dockerfile + README to Git repository with:

git add .
git commit -m "Assignment files uploaded"
git push


How this assignment helped me learn DevOps, Linux, Git, and Docker :-

- I practiced Linux commands inside a controlled container environment  
- I learned how Docker builds, tags, and distributes images  
- I used Git to track changes and publish work  
- I understood how DevOps ideas connect to automation and repeatability  
- This hands-on workflow strengthened real-world practical skills
