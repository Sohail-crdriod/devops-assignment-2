Five DevOps Concepts :-

🔹 Commit 
-A saved snapshot of work
-Helps track what changed and when

🔹 Pair Programming
-Two developers share one task
-One types, one reviews in real time

🔹 Rollback
-Returning to a working version when something breaks
-Prevents downtime and failures

🔹 Continuous Deployment
-Code that passes automated tests goes live automatically
-No human approval needed

🔹 Continuous Integration
-Developers merge updates frequently
-Helps catch errors early

How the assignment was completed :-

-Made a GitHub repository and opened it locally
-Built a Dockerfile that performs basic Linux operations using simple shell utilities
-Constructed the Docker image using docker build -t linux-ops-box
-Tagged the image for DockerHub with docker tag linux-ops-box sohail222/linux-ops-box:v1
-Uploaded it using docker push sohail222/linux-ops-box:v1
-My Dockerhub link https://hub.docker.com/r/sohail222/linux-ops-box

Added Dockerfile + README to Git repository with:

git add .
git commit -m "Assignment files uploaded"
git push
Included all 5 DevOps concepts in README.md and synced changes

How this assignment helped me learn DevOps, Linux, Git, and Docker :-

-I practiced Linux commands inside a controlled container environment
-I learned how Docker builds, tags, and distributes images
-I used Git to track changes and publish work
-I understood how DevOps ideas connect to automation and repeatability
-This hands-on workflow strengthened real-world practical skills
